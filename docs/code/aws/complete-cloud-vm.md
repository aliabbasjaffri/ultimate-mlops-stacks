# AWS Complete Deployment üåê

This directory contains YAML configurations for setting up a complete infrastructure on AWS. These files are designed to facilitate the deployment of cloud resources, with options for both basic and advanced configurations.

## Directory Structure

- `aws-complete.yaml`: Basic configuration file for deploying essential cloud infrastructure on AWS.
- `aws-complete-advanced.yaml`: Advanced configuration file that includes enhanced features for scalability, security, and performance optimization.

## Deployment Instructions

### 1. Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- An AWS account with the necessary permissions to create and manage resources.
- AWS CLI installed and configured with your credentials.
- `cloudformation` permissions to deploy AWS infrastructure.

### 2. Basic Deployment

To deploy the basic infrastructure, use the following command:

```bash
aws cloudformation deploy --template-file aws-complete.yaml --stack-name basic-aws-stack
```

### 3. Advanced Deployment

For a more comprehensive setup with additional features, execute:

```bash
aws cloudformation deploy --template-file aws-complete-advanced.yaml --stack-name advanced-aws-stack
```

### 4. Verifying Deployment

To verify that your infrastructure has been set up correctly, check the status of your CloudFormation stack:

```bash
aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name basic-aws-stack
```

Or for the advanced setup:

```bash
aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name advanced-aws-stack
```

### 5. Managing Resources

You can manage and monitor your deployed resources through the AWS Management Console. Use the CloudFormation section to view your stacks, events, and outputs for further details.
