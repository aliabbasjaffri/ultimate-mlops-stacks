# Complete Deployment on Kubernetes 🚀

This directory contains YAML configurations for deploying a complete solution on a Kubernetes cluster. These configurations are designed to help you set up an entire application stack using Kubernetes.

## 📂 Files Included

- **`aws-complete.yaml`**: Basic configuration for deploying a complete solution on a Kubernetes cluster.
- **`aws-complete-advanced.yaml`**: Advanced configuration for deploying a complete solution with additional features and optimizations.

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- An existing Kubernetes cluster (e.g., Amazon EKS, GKE, AKS, or any self-managed cluster).
- `kubectl` installed and configured to connect to your Kubernetes cluster.
- Necessary permissions for creating resources in the Kubernetes cluster.
- Docker images for your application available, or use existing images.

## 📦 Deployment Instructions

### 1. Basic Complete Deployment

To deploy the complete solution using the basic setup, run:

```bash
kubectl apply -f aws-complete.yaml
```

This configuration is suitable for basic usage and testing.

### 2. Advanced Complete Deployment

For a more robust deployment that includes optimizations and additional features, use the advanced configuration:

```bash
kubectl apply -f aws-complete-advanced.yaml
```

This file allows for customizations such as:

- **Increased resource requests/limits for better performance**
- **Integration with external services**
- **Enhanced monitoring and logging features**

### 3. Verifying Your Deployment

To check the status of your deployments, use:

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

You can also check the services to see if they are running correctly:

```bash
kubectl get svc
```

### 4. Accessing the Application

Once deployed, you can access your application via the service endpoints. If the services are not exposed externally, you may need to set up port forwarding:

```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/<your-service-name> 8080:80
```

Replace `<your-service-name>` with the name of your service. Visit `http://localhost:8080` to access your application.

## 🔧 Customization Tips

- **Scaling**: Modify replica counts in the YAML files to adjust the number of instances running.
- **Resource Allocation**: Tweak resource requests and limits based on application needs.
- **Environment Variables**: Set any required environment variables directly in the YAML files.

## 🧹 Cleanup

To delete your complete deployment:

```bash
kubectl delete -f aws-complete.yaml
kubectl delete -f aws-complete-advanced.yaml
```
